/**
  @mainpage The ACT Library
 
This contains the documentation for the APIs provided by the core
ACT library, available via github at
https://github.com/asyncvlsi/act The top-level API is provided by
the Act class. This class is used to read in an ACT design file and
provides basic operations such as merging in additional files into
the design and expanding the design. After a file is read in, core
data structures that represent the entire design are created and
available for manipulation.  The core data structures represent all
aspects of the design in a hierarchical fashion.

The basic usage of the library is the following:

1. Read in the ACT files to be processed.
2. Expand the design.
3. Access and potentially transform the expanded circuit definitions.

Before any of these steps, the Act library should be initialized via
the call:

```
Act::Init (&argc, &argv);
```

Here ``argc``/``argv`` are the standard C command-line arguments. The
common ACT command-line arguments are extracted by this process.
 
## Step 1: Reading in files

In this step the ACT files are parsed, and the syntax is type-checked
to identify potential errors in the input. Files may be rejected at
this stage, in which case the library will exit with a fatal error
message along with information to help the user identify the location
and cause of the error.

To read in a design contained in the ACT file ``test.act``, use
```
Act *a = new Act ("test.act");
```
The returned data structure can be used to access the entire design
hierarchy. If additional ACT files need to be read in (beyond those
imported directly from the original ACT file), then additional files
can be merged into the Act data structure using
```
a->Merge ("extra.act");
```

All instances and user-defined types are associated with a _namespace_
(represented using the ActNamespace class). In the absence of a
namespace specifier, instances/types are part of the default global
namespace that is always present in the ACT data structures.

```

ActNamespace *ns = a->Global();

```

The global namespace can also be accessed using the static method
ActNamespace::Global() for convenience in case the Act pointer is
unavailable.

If an ACT file contains multiple namespaces, then a specific
namespaces can be accessed as follows:
```
ActNamespace *arith_ns = a->findNamespace ("arithmetic");
```

The names of user-defined types (processes, channels, data types) at this stage in the design correspond to the name in their ACT definitions. For example, the process
```

template<pint N> defproc adder (bool a[N], b[N], out[N]) { ... }

```
can be found via its name `"adder"` within the namespace in which the
type is defined.
If this was defined in the global namespace and included in the
`test.act`, then the data structure for the process can be accessed
using
```

Process *p = a->findProcess ("adder");

```

If, instead, the adder was defined within the arithmetic namespace,
then it can be accessed using
```

Process *p = a->findProcess (arith_ns, "adder");

```


## Step 2: Expanding the design

In this step, the design is expanded/elaborated. ACT permits designs
to be specified in a parameterized fashion. For example, a user could
design an N-bit adder. In this step, all parameters are expanded out
into their actual values, and the values are substituted throughout
the design. At this stage, all array dimensions are finalized, and so
any incompatibilities in array sizes/connections can also result in an
error being reported. Other errors that can be reported in this stage
include assertion failures, as well as type override errors.

To expand the Act data structure, use:
```

Act *a = new Act("test.act");

a->Expand();

```


At this stage, the expanded types can be found in the ACT data
structures. For example, if the design included an instance of type
`"adder<8>"`, then the string `"adder<8>"` will get added to the
namespace definition, and this corresponds to the definition of the
adder with the value `8` substituted for `N` throughout its
definition. For a type definition without any template parameters, the
expanded definitions will have empty angle brackets after them. For
example, an and gate called ``AND2X1`` without any parameters will be
expanded to `AND2X1<>`. Both the unexpanded definitions and expanded
definitions can be found in the namespace.

Reading in expanded processes operates in the same way as earlier:

```
Process *p = a->findProcess ("adder<8>");
```

This will return an expanded process (or NULL if not found).

Integer template parameters are added to the type name for expanded
types as described above. Multiple parameters will be separated by
commas. Boolean template parameters are printed as either `t` or
`f` (for true and false), and real parameters appear as real
numbers. Arrays of parameters are specified using curly braces to
demarcate the array, followed by a comma-separated list of array
element values. This is used for both one-dimensional as well as
multi-dimensional arrays, since the number of dimensions and the shape
of the array is known.

In addition to substituting values of parameters, the expansion
process will also eliminate all conditional and loop constructs from
any definitions. This means that an expanded type will contain data
structures corresponding to the names of instances and their expanded
types, connection information, and expanded sub-language definitions
(if any).


## Step 3: Access and manipulate designs

Most of the work in manipulating a design operates on the expanded ACT
description. This starts with accessing the data structure for a
namespace or user-defined type. While ``findProcess()`` can be used to
find a user-defined process, other user-defined types (channel and
data types) can be accessed using
```
UserDef *u = a->findUserdef ("datatypename");
```

The data structures for user-defined types have APIs that can be used
to access/manipulate the design. The primary data structures are
namespaces and user-defined types. Namespaces contain global instances
and connections, definitions of nested namespaces, and user-defined
types. User-defined types contain their port and template parameters,
instances within the user-defined type and connections, and any
sub-language bodies. The global namespace can also contain
sub-language bodies.

A commonly used pattern is to apply some analysis/transformation to
every process/user-defined type in the user design, starting from some
top-level process name. Act has a built-in notion of an Act _pass_
(supported by the ActPass class) that includes traversal methods/etc.


### Unexpanded designs

When a design is unexpanded, the primary data structures hold
unexpanded values. The design information is contained within the
ActBody data structure associated with each namespace and user-defined
type (a UserDef). In addition, names that are associated with
instances types are also available in the instance tables in each
ActNamespace and UserDef.

### Expanded designs

Expanded namespaces and user-defined types no longer contain any
ActBody references. Instead, the precise list of instances are
available via the ActNamespace or UserDef. The main data type used to
represent an instance is a ValueIdx. In addition, each instance and
name has an associated act_connection structure. This connection
maintains connectivity information and can be used to determine local
connectivity information within a user-defined type or namespace.

The ACT library provides a number of iterators (in iter.h) that
can be used to walk through elements of a number of different data
structures. 

## ACT Passes

The standard ActPass library contains a collection of pre-defined
passes that are used by many of the standard ACT tools. Each pass
has an associated class name and a string name. These passes are
combined into the ACT pass library (libactpass.a or
libactpass_sh.so) and installed with the ACT repository.

The standard passes are:

  Pass Name    | Class 
  -------------| -----
  booleanize   | ActBooleanizePass
  sizing       | ActSizingPass
  prs2net      | ActNetlistPass
  prs2cells    | ActCellPass
  collect_state| ActStatePass
  apply        | ActApplyPass
  finline      | ActCHPFuncInline
  chpmem       | ActCHPMemory
  chparb       | ActCHPArbiter


## Name mangling

Expanded ACT type names can contain characters like `<`, `>`, and
`,` (among others). Instances can have names like `a[3].b[5].z`,
including the characters `[`, `]`, and `.`.  When exporting an
ACT design to another format for use by a third-party tool, names with
such characters in them can be potentially problematic. A good example
of this is when exporting a SPICE netlist---different versions of
SPICE have different syntactic restrictions. To handle this in a
disciplined manner, the ACT library has the notion of a //mangled//
name. A mangled name is generated by re-writing a user-specified list
of special characters with an underscore and a number/character
combination. This mapping is invertible, so a name can be unmangled as
well. The set of characters to be mangled is specified in the ACT
configuration option `act.mangle_string`.

The standard name mangling prefix character is an underscore. Name
mangling operates character-by-character as follows:

1. An underscore is replaced by two underscores.
2. A character that is not in the mangle string is a pass-through, so
it is not modified.
3. If a character is at position k in the name mangling string, it is
replaced with an underscore followed by k. The position character is 0
to 9 for positions 0 to 9, followed by a-z. Up to 36 characters can be
mangled.

Name mangling can at most double the length of the string. Various
APIs to mangle and unmangle names are part of the Act class, such as
Act::mfprintf() and Act::msnprintf().

Process names have a special case in terms of name mangling. If an
expanded process has no parameters, its mangled name is obtained
simply be omitting the trailing `<>`.

 *   @class ActPass
 *
 *   @brief The main ActPass class used to implement an ACT
 *   analysis/synthesis pass. All the core tools use this framework to
 *   operate on the ACT data structures. Passes are called once the
 *   design has been expanded.
 *
 *   The basic operation of a pass can modify the internals of a
 *   user-defined type, and/or compute some auxillary information that
 *   is saved away in a data structure that is indexed by the
 *   user-defined type pointer. This data can be accessed after a pass
 *   has been run.
 *
 *   A pass operates recursively on the design/type hierarchy. If a
 *   user-defined type instantiates another user-defined type, then
 *   the types for each instance are processed before the parent
 *   type. Hence, information computed about the instances are
 *   available to the parent. Each user-defined type that is part of
 *   the design hierarchy is visited exactly once during the design
 *   traversal.
 *
 *   A pass can also depend on information computed by another
 *   pass. These dependencies are explicitly specified in the pass
 *   constructor using the AddDependency() call. This tracks both
 *   forward and backward dependencies---i.e. other passes that depend
 *   on the ActPass, and other passes that the ActPass depend on. A
 *   cyclic dependency is detected and reported as an error.
 *
 *   When a pass is run via ActPass::run() , any of its dependencies
 *   are automatically executed (if they have not already been
 *   run). Additionally, it is possible for a pass to run any passes
 *   that depend on what has been re-computed via the
 *   ActPass::update() call.
 *
 *   The standard passes that are included in the core ACT library are
 *   documented in the Act Pass library documentation.
